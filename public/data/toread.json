Using a sample that resembles the US voting-age population, the study directly measures each individual’s ad exposure through a user-level real-time ad tracking tool, which is merged with the same individual’s survey respo...",

However, the mechanisms by which triads in these networks become transitive are largely unexplored. We leverage a unique combination of data and methods to demonstrate a causal link between amplification and triad transitivity in a directed social network. Additionally, we develop the concept of the “attention broker,” an extension of the previously theo...",

      "abstract": "Data annotation and synthesis generally refers to the labeling or generating of raw data with relevant information, which could be used for improving the efficacy of machine learning models. The process, however, is labor-intensive and costly. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-4, presents an unprecedented opportunity to automate the complicated process of data annotation and synthesis. While existing surveys have extensively covered LLM architecture, trai...",

      "abstract": "Abstract We present a method for estimating the ideology of political YouTube videos. The subfield of estimating ideology as a latent variable has often focused on traditional actors such as legislators, while more recent work has used social media data to estimate the ideology of ordinary users, political elites, and media sources. We build on this work to estimate the ideology of a political YouTube video. First, we start with a matrix of political Reddit posts linking to YouTube videos and ap...",
