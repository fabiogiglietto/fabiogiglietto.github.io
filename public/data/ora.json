      "abstract": "In February 2016, Facebook expanded the original \"Like\" button by introducing five additional \"Reactions\"-Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry-using modified versions of Unicode emojis. These reactions enable users to express more nuanced emotions towards posts. This literature review investigates scholarly research on user behavior in response to these reactions, with a focus on a broad spectrum of socioeconomic and psychological issues. We conducted a systematic search across databases including Scopus and Google Scholar, using keywords such as \"Facebook\" and \"Reaction,\" combined with various key phrases and Boolean operators. Our review synthesizes sixty-four articles published from 2016 to 2023, exploring diverse topics such as political news, far-right and extremist parties, racism, and hate speech during the COVID-19 pandemic. We organized these articles by theme and publication date. Our meta-analysis reveals that lifestyle and entertainment posts predominantly receive positive reactions, while sociopolitical content tends to elicit a broader spectrum of emotions, including negative sentiments. Furthermore, emotionally charged content consistently attracts higher volumes of reactions, regardless of sentiment. This research highlights the intricate relationship between user reactions and content characteristics, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of online engagement. By understanding these interaction patterns, we gain a better grasp of emotional responses and engagement levels, which ultimately shape online discourse and user interactions.",

      "abstract": "Public figures and influencers seem to play an increasingly important role in the contemporary media ecosystem. Their statements circulate quickly, seemingly moving from broadcast to digital media and from the titles of news stories to memes. This paper studies the role played by these dynamics among the Alternative Influence Network (AIN) during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis in Italy by leveraging a dataset of 175,228 Facebook posts created over one year by a list of covid-skeptic accounts. Findings contribute to shed some light on the role played by the AIN on news circulation in the contemporary hybrid media ecosystem and inter-media agenda setting. What is more, findings suggest that hybridity also takes place through remediation, where media production includes how these claims are consumed and circulated.",

Leveraging an updated version of the same data source —Meta’s URL Shares Dataset —and  replicating  much  of  the methodology,  we  quantify  the  trustworthy  and  untrustworthy  links  to external websites that have been shared on Facebook in the period between 2019 and 2022 in three  major European countries (Germany,  France,  and Italy).  We  observe  a  clear  decline  in  the  number  of  URLs  present  in  the dataset  and  an  increase  in  the  URLs  from  untrustworthy  domains  as  a percentage  of  the  total  URLs  shared  in  a  year.  This  increase  seems  to  be higher in electoral years (in Germany and in Italy) but itdoes not translate into an increase of Views received from untrustworthy sources.",

The study analyzes posts collected through CrowdTangle mentioning a set of political keywords published on Facebook Pages/groups and Instagram accounts between 21 July, when Draghi resigned as Prime Minister, and 25 September 2022, the day of the election. A breakout algorithm detector is used to identify peaks in daily engagement, and for each peak, the main topics were identified using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). The chapter provides insight into the trends and topics that were most likely to drive engagement on these platforms during the campaign period. The results of the study may be useful for understanding the role of social media in political communication and for identifying the most effective strategies for reaching and engaging with voters through these channels.",

      "abstract": "In dieser Studie analysieren wir die organische und bezahlte Social-Media-Kommunikation politischer Kandidieren- der, Parteien und anderen Social-Media-Nutzerinnen und Nutzern im Vorfeld der deutschen Bundestagswahl 2021. Wir dokumentieren die Investitionen der wichtigsten Parteien in Facebook-Werbung, ihre Targeting-Strategien und das Engagement, das sie organisch erreicht haben, sowie die Aktivität koordinierter Netzwerke von Facebook-Seiten und -Gruppen, die sich mit der Wahl befassen.\r\nWie schon im Jahr 2019 (Hegelich & Serrano, 2019) erreichte die AfD ein außergewöhnlich hohes Engagement auf Facebook. Aber nicht die CDU, sondern Die Grünen führten die Rangliste der Facebook-Werbeinvestitionen im Jahr 2021 an. Dennoch wurden beide bei der Gesamtzahl der Anzeigenaufrufe von der FDP überholt, die insgesamt weni- ger ausgab, aber eine höhere Anzahl von Anzeigen schaltete.\r\nBei der Betrachtung von Microtargeting zeigen unsere Ergebnisse, dass der Inhalt einiger Anzeigen ausschließlich auf Frauen oder junge Generationen ausgerichtet war. Sie machten jedoch nur einen geringen Anteil an der Gesamt- zahl der von Parteien und Kandidierenden geschalteten Anzeigen aus.\r\nDes Weiteren fanden wir große koordinierte Netzwerke auf Facebook (Giglietto, Righetti, Rossi, & Marino, 2020), die Anti-Establishment-Narrative sowie Botschaften gegen die Corona Schutzmaßnahmen und gegen die COVID-19- Politik im Allgemeinen verbreiteten. In diesen Netzwerken waren harsche Kommentare gegen die Gegnerinnen und Gegner und ein breites Spektrum an Quellen, die Desinformationen (NewsGuard, 2021) während der Wahlen verbreiteten, üblich.\r\nBei der Betrachtung der Ergebnisse muss beachtet werden, dass die hier durchgeführten Analysen aufgrund von Ein- schränkungen beim Datenzugang schnell an Grenzen gestoßen sind. Insbesondere das Fehlen von Facebook-Daten über die Aktivitäten einzelner Nutzerinnen und Nutzer verhindert die Untersuchung des möglichen Einsatzes von Bots, die in schneller Abfolge Inhalte in mehreren öffentlichen Gruppen posten und die Interaktionsmetriken aufblähen. Das Fehlen von Daten über Facebook-Kommentare verhindert die Analyse koordinierter Strategien, die darauf abzielen, unter dem Radar von Faktenprüferinnen und Faktenprüfern und Reglementierung durch die Plattform zu bleiben. Der Mangel an genaueren Daten über Werbung hat uns auch daran gehindert, neben den allgemeinen Fällen in Bezug auf Geschlecht und Alter auch Microtargeting-Strategien zu untersuchen.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we analyze organic and paid social media communication from political candidates, parties, and other social media users, in the lead-up to the 2021 German federal election. We document the investment in Facebook advertising of the main parties and their targeting strategies, the engagement they reached organically, and the activity of coordinated networks of Facebook pages and groups dealing with the election.\r\n\r\nAs in 2019 (Hegelich & Serrano, 2019), the AfD reached an exceptionally high engagement on Facebook, but Die Grünen, instead of CDU, led the standings of the Facebook advertisement investment in 2021. Nonetheless, they were both outrun in the overall number of ad impressions by the FDP, who strategically spent less on a higher number of advertisements.\r\nConsidering the area of microtargeting, our findings show that the content of some advertisements was exclusively targeted to women or young generations. They, however, represented just a modest part of the total number of advertisements run by parties and candidates.\r\nWe also found large coordinated networks on Facebook (Giglietto, Righetti, Rossi, & Marino, 2020) spreading anti-establishment narratives, as well as anti-lockdown and anti-COVID19 policies messages. In these networks, harsh comments against opponents and a wide range of sources that shared disinformation (NewsGuard, 2021) during the elections were common.\r\nThe analyses herein conducted quickly ran into limitations in data access. In particular, the lack of Facebook data on the activity of individual users prevented exploring the possible use of bots to quickly cross-post content in public groups and inflate engagement metrics. The lack of data on Facebook comments prevented the analysis of coordi- nated strategies aimed at staying under the radar of fact-checkers and platforms censoring. The lack of fine-grained data on advertising also prevented us from investigating microtargeting strategies besides general cases related to gender and age.",

      "abstract": "Social media, as many scholars have shown, can be used to influence political behavior through coordinated disinformation campaigns in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens. With a specific reference to Facebook, a recent study has spotlighted patterns of coordinated activity aimed at fueling online circulation of specific news stories before the 2018 and 2019 Italian elections, an activity called by the authors “Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior” (CLSB). More precisely, CLSB refers to the coordinated shares of the same news articles in a very short time by networks of entities composed by Facebook pages, groups and verified public profiles. The uncertainty related to the coronavirus outbreak is a unique chance for malicious actors to leverage the anxiety of online publics to reach their goals, filling the information void with problematic content. Considering the association between coordination, media manipulation, and problematic information, the entities involved in coordinated online activities represent a privileged perspective on these phenomena. Thus, against the backdrop of the literature and the already conducted studies, this proposal will discuss Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior in the context of the coronavirus outbreak informational void, analyzing network mutations over time and the content strategies used to exploit the ambiguity associated with the topic.",
