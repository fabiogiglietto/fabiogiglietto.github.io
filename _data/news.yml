    A new tool called FG's Research Radio has been developed, leveraging AI to
    create audio deep dives into computational social science papers. This tool
    pulls directly from a PaperPile reading list, generating audio summaries for
    convenient research consumption. The code is open-source and designed for
    researchers to create their own instances using Google Gemini.

    Research indicates that Meta's political content policy resulted in a 72%
    reach reduction for Italian Members of Parliament. The effects were detected
    10 months before Meta's global rollout, with extremists gaining reach (+14%)
    while elected officials experienced a loss. The study is available as a
    preprint and encourages researchers with access to the Meta Content Library
    to replicate it in other countries.

    A series of recent publications have caught attention, including studies on:
    the influence of industry on social media research, the discursive
    flexibility of 'changecraft' on platforms like Meta and TikTok, visual
    analysis of the Sweden Democrats' EU election campaign, the impact of
    fallacies in climate change misinformation, the 'Tate-space' on YouTube,
    cross-national evidence of media visibility for the Radical Right in the
    2024 European elections, and the propaganda team of Prigozhin.
