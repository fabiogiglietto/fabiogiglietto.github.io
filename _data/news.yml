    A new tool, FG's Research Radio, has been developed, leveraging AI to create
    audio deep dives into Computational Social Science papers. The tool, which
    draws directly from a PaperPile reading list, generates AI-driven audio
    summaries of academic papers, designed for efficient research consumption.
    The code is open source, and users can set up their own instance using
    Google Gemini.

    months prior to Meta's global rollout, with extremist content gaining reach
    (+14%) while elected officials experienced a loss. The related research is
    available as a preprint.
