    Recent studies highlight the pervasive challenges of misinformation and
    disinformation. One paper investigates elected officials' online sharing of
    misinformation, examining institutional and ideological checks. Another
    explores how the difficulty in identifying (deep)fake news impacts
    self-confidence in truth discernment and susceptibility to subsequent
    disinformation. Furthermore, research assesses the effectiveness of
    prebunking misinformation techniques on social media platforms like
    Instagram.

    Several papers address the role and impact of Large Language Models (LLMs)
    within communication research and beyond. One study critiques the
    unreflective adoption of LLMs in communication research. Another explores
    how LLMs require curated context for reliable political fact-checking, even
    with reasoning and web search capabilities. Additionally, research
    integrates topic modeling and LLM prompt engineering into a human-driven
    approach for analyzing interview transcripts.
