    A tool called FG's Research Radio has been developed, leveraging AI to
    generate audio deep dives into computational social science papers. The tool
    pulls from a PaperPile reading list and is designed to help researchers
    catch up on literature during commutes. The code is open source and
    available on GitHub.

    An observation was made regarding a fine levied against X, where €40 million
    was specifically for data access breaches affecting researchers. It was
    suggested that the wasted time by researchers with the inadequate Google
    form created by X for DSA compliance should be compensated from this fine.
