    A new tool, FG's Research Radio, has been developed to generate AI-driven
    audio deep dives into computational social science papers. The tool utilizes
    a PaperPile reading list and is designed to help researchers catch up on
    papers while commuting. The code is open source and available for users to
    create their own instances using Google Gemini.

    Recent research indicates that Meta's political content policy led to a 72%
    reduction in reach for Italian Members of Parliament on Facebook. This
    effect was observed ten months before Meta's global rollout. The research
    also suggests that extremists gained reach (+14%) while elected officials
    experienced a loss.

    Several recently highlighted papers explore critical topics in media and
    online communication, including a megastudy on the persuasiveness of climate
    messages, cross-national evidence of disproportionate media visibility for
    the radical right in the 2024 European elections, and an analysis of
    Prigozhin's propaganda team at the St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency
    (2013-2021). Other notable works examine social bots as agenda-builders, the
    logic of connective faction in radicalizing politics, and the generative AI
    paradox related to trust and information verification.
