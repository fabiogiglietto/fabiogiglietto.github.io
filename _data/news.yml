    A new preprint examines how Meta's political content policy, specifically
    the reversal of its political content reduction strategy one year prior,
    significantly impacted the reach of Italian Members of Parliament (MPs). The
    research, analyzing 2.5 million Facebook posts, found a 72% reach reduction
    for parliamentarians, with effects detected 10 months before the global
    rollout of the policy. Notably, extremist content saw a 14% increase in
    reach, while elected officials experienced a decrease. The research includes
    open-source code for replication and extension to other countries.

    A tool, dubbed FG's Research Radio, has been developed that generates
    AI-driven audio deep dives into computational social science papers. The
    tool utilizes Google Gemini and pulls directly from a PaperPile reading
    list. The code is open source.

    The researcher highlights a number of recent papers to read, covering a
    range of topics relevant to computational social science. These include
    studies on research opportunities and challenges related to the EU's Digital
    Services Act, the influence of industry on social media research, and the
    'Generative AI Paradox,' exploring the erosion of trust and information
    verification due to generative AI.
