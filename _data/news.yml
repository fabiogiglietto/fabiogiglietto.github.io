    New research indicates that Meta's political content reduction policy,
    implemented a year prior, led to a 72% reach reduction for Italian Members
    of Parliament on Facebook. The study, analyzing 2.5 million posts, found
    that the effects were detectable 10 months before the global rollout.
    Notably, extremist content saw an increase in reach (+14%), while elected
    officials experienced a decrease. Code and data are available for
    replication.

    An AI-driven tool, dubbed FG's Research Radio, has been developed to
    generate audio deep dives into computational social science papers. The tool
    pulls directly from a PaperPile reading list. The code is open source and
    available for others to use.
