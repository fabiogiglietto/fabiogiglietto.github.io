    A preprint analyzing Meta's political content policy reveals a 72% reduction
    in reach for Italian Members of Parliament following the policy's
    implementation. The research, based on an analysis of 2.5 million Facebook
    posts, detected these effects 10 months before Meta's global rollout, with
    extremist content unexpectedly gaining reach (+14%). Researchers are
    encouraging further investigation in other countries with Meta Content
    Library access.

    An AI-driven tool, FG's Research Radio, has been developed to generate audio
    deep dives into computational social science papers. This tool, which pulls
    directly from a PaperPile reading list, allows users to stay current on
    research by listening to AI-generated summaries. The code is open-source.

    Several recently highlighted papers explore critical aspects of digital
    media and society. These include investigations into the EU's Digital
    Services Act, the role of Large Language Models in data annotation,
    cross-platform discourse networks, the social media production-consumption
    gap, coordinated social media manipulation, and the post-API age of social
    media data access.
