    New research highlights that Meta's political content policy led to a 72%
    reduction in reach for Italian Members of Parliament. The study, which
    examined 2.5 million Facebook posts, indicated that the effects were
    observed 10 months before Meta's global rollout. Extremist groups
    experienced a reach increase of 14%, while elected officials saw a decrease.
    The code and data are openly available for researchers to replicate the
    study in other countries.

    An AI-driven tool, 'FG's Research Radio,' has been developed to generate
    audio deep dives into computational social science papers. The tool utilizes
    a PaperPile reading list and Google Gemini to create audio summaries,
    designed to facilitate research engagement during commutes. The code is open
    source, allowing users to create their own instances.
