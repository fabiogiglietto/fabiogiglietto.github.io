    A new tool, FG's Research Radio, has been developed that uses AI to generate
    audio deep dives into computational social science papers. The tool pulls
    directly from a PaperPile reading list and the open-source code is available
    for others to create their own instance using Google Gemini.

    Recent research on 2.5 million Facebook posts from Italian Members of
    Parliament reveals that Meta's political content reduction policy led to a
    72% reach reduction for parliamentarians. The effects were detected 10
    months before Meta's global rollout. Interestingly, extremist content gained
    reach (+14%) during this period, while elected officials experienced a loss.

    A newly released preprint indicates that Meta's political content policy
    resulted in a substantial 72% reduction in the reach of Italian MPs. The
    study encourages researchers with access to the Meta Content Library to
    replicate the analysis for other countries such as Germany, France, or
    Brazil, with code available on GitHub.
