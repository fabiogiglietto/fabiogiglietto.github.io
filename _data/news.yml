    A new tool, FG's Research Radio, has been developed for AI-driven audio deep
    dives into computational social science papers. This open-source project
    generates audio summaries from a PaperPile reading list, enabling users to
    catch up on research while commuting or performing other activities. The
    code is available for others to adapt using Google Gemini.

    Research indicates that Meta's political content policy resulted in a 72%
    reduction in reach for Italian Members of Parliament on Facebook. The
    effects were detected ten months before the global rollout of Meta's
    policies. Interestingly, extremist content saw a reach increase of 14%,
    while elected officials experienced a decline. Researchers encourage others
    with Meta Content Library access to replicate the study in other countries.

    Several new papers have been highlighted, focusing on diverse aspects of
    social media and online discourse. These include investigations into trust
    and utility of news chatbots among those with varying conspiracy beliefs,
    the discursive flexibility of platform change discourse across major
    platforms, industry influence in social media research, the visual analysis
    of the Sweden Democrats' EU election campaign, and the impact of fallacies
    in climate change misinformation.
