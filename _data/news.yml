    Several recent publications focus on the role of AI and fact-checking in
    contemporary media. Among them, one paper explores fact-checking as an
    epistemological lens in the age of generative AI, while another examines how
    AI is perceived by the industry during the Sam Altman controversy. A third
    study investigates the influence of AI-generated disclosures on user
    credibility and engagement with fact-checking videos on Chinese TikTok
    (Douyin).

    Recent research explores the landscape of online (mis)information. One study
    examines the effects of anti-vaccine tweets on COVID-19 vaccinations, cases,
    and deaths. Another investigates exposure to low-credibility online health

    paper analyzes the role of the term 'fake news' in U.S. alternative media
    and its contribution to shaping political discourse and hyperpartisanship.
