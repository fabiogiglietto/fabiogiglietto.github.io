    A new study analyzes data from 2.5 million Facebook posts by Italian Members
    of Parliament following Meta's reversal of its political content reduction
    policy. The research indicates a 72% reach reduction for parliamentarians,
    with the effects observed 10 months before Meta's global rollout. Notably,
    extremist content experienced a 14% increase in reach, contrasting with the
    decline for elected officials. The research highlights the potential impact
    of platform governance on political discourse.
