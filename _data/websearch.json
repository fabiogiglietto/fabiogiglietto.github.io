    "snippet": "This YouTube video from February 14, 2026, features Elisabetta Piccolotti discussing a study by Professor Fabio Giglietto of the University of Urbino, which allegedly demonstrates that Meta favored homophobic, racist, and fake news posts over content from politicians. Piccolotti claims that American Big Tech companies are influencing elections worldwide, and that Meta applied a filter between 2021 and 2024 that reduced the visibility of posts from official politicians by 72% while increasing the visibility of extreme right-wing influencers with racist, homophobic, hateful, and fake news messages.",
