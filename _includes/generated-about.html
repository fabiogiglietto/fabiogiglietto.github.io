<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he leads teaching and research on the social implications of digital media. His work examines the relationships between social systems, media, and digital technologies, with a particular focus on how information circulates across platforms and how platform dynamics shape public discourse. He has published extensively in leading journals, including Journal of Communication, Information, Communication &amp; Society, Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review.</p>
<p>His research contributes to the fields of computational social science, platform studies, and the analysis of mis/disinformation. Among his most cited works are studies of second-screen participation on Twitter, the methodological potentials and limits of using social platforms as data sources, and investigations into coordinated link-sharing behavior during national elections. His publications also include analyses of the dynamics of false information within hybrid news systems and the discursive strategies surrounding major breaking-news events, reflecting a sustained interest in how attention, coordination, and credibility are produced and contested online.</p>
<p>Current projects build on this trajectory by combining large-scale platform data with theory-driven analyses of information flows, influence operations, and media ecosystems. He regularly engages with ongoing debates on data access, platform governance, and the reproducibility of digital research, and he collaborates with interdisciplinary teams to develop transparent, accountable methodologies for studying online political communication. His recent public-facing commentary and scholarly activity highlight evolving patterns of cross-platform coordination, the role of algorithmic curation in shaping news exposure, and best practices for auditing platform interventions.</p>
<p>At the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Professor Giglietto mentors students and early-career researchers working at the intersection of media studies and computational approaches. He is actively involved in international research networks and contributes to comparative projects that monitor political communication and disinformation across electoral cycles. With a portfolio of 20 publications and over 1,700 citations, his work informs academics, journalists, and policymakers seeking rigorous, evidence-based insights into the social life of information in the platform era.</p>
