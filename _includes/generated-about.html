<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo. His work examines the relationships between social systems, media, and digital technologies, with an emphasis on the theory of information, communication, and society. He teaches courses in Internet Studies and regularly collaborates on interdisciplinary projects that bridge communication research, computational methods, and public-interest technology.</p>
<p>Giglietto’s research has been widely published in leading journals, including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication & Society, the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. His publications span foundational analyses of second-screen participation and the methodological challenges of using social platforms as research data sources, to recent investigations into coordinated link-sharing behaviors, misinformation dynamics, and discursive strategies in hybrid media systems. Notable works include “Second Screen and Participation: A Content Analysis on a Full Season Dataset of Tweets,” “The Open Laboratory: Limits and Possibilities of Using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a Research Data Source,” and “It Takes a Village to Manipulate the Media: Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior During 2018 and 2019 Italian Elections.”</p>
<p>In his current projects, Giglietto focuses on the computational analysis of social media ecosystems, emerging patterns of disinformation, and the measurement of platform interventions during elections and crises. He engages with ongoing discussions about the transparency and governance of digital platforms, drawing on mixed-methods approaches that combine large-scale data collection with qualitative insights. Building on sustained collaborations across academia, civil society, and news organizations, his work aims to inform evidence-based policy and strengthen the integrity of online public discourse.</p>
<p>Across research, teaching, and public engagement, Giglietto maintains an active presence in scholarly and professional networks, where he shares updates on new studies, methodological advances, and collaborative initiatives related to social media analysis and computational social science. He is committed to open, reproducible research practices and to mentoring students and early-career researchers working at the intersection of communication theory, data science, and democratic resilience.</p>
