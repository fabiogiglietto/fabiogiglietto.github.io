<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he teaches Internet Studies and leads research at the intersection of communication, society, and digital technologies. His work examines how media systems and social platforms shape public discourse, with a particular focus on the theory of information, the dynamics of attention, and the interplay between social systems and digital infrastructures.</p>
<p>Giglietto has published extensively in leading journals, including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication &amp; Society, the Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. His highly cited studies span second-screen participation, platform data as research infrastructure, and information manipulation in hybrid media systems. Representative works include “Second Screen and Participation: A Content Analysis on a Full Season Dataset of Tweets,” “The Open Laboratory: Limits and Possibilities of Using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a Research Data Source,” and “It Takes a Village to Manipulate the Media: Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior during the 2018 and 2019 Italian Elections.”</p>
<p>His current research centers on the detection and analysis of coordinated online behaviors, the circulation of false and misleading information, and the methodological challenges of studying social platforms at scale. Drawing on computational social science and mixed-method approaches, he investigates how news, political messaging, and grassroots communities interact across platforms, and how platform governance and data access shape what scholars and the public can know about digital publics. He frequently shares research insights and ongoing project updates through professional networks, highlighting collaborations that bridge academic rigor with policy-relevant impact.</p>
<p>Across more than 20 publications and a substantial citation record, Giglietto’s work informs debates on media accountability, platform transparency, and the resilience of democratic communication. As Professor of Internet Studies, he mentors students and early-career researchers, collaborates with international teams, and contributes to public conversations about disinformation, media manipulation, and the evolving role of platforms in contemporary society.</p>
