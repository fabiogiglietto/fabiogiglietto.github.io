<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is a Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he also teaches Internet Studies. His work examines the theory of information, communication, and society, with a particular focus on how social systems, media, and digital technologies shape one another. He has published widely in leading venues including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication & Society, the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review.</p>
<p>Professor Giglietto’s research explores the dynamics of digital publics, the circulation of misinformation and disinformation, and the methods and ethics of computational social science. His contributions include highly cited studies on second-screen participation, the opportunities and limits of using social platforms as research data sources, and the identification of coordinated link-sharing behavior around elections. He also investigates the hybrid news system and discursive strategies on social media during high-impact events, advancing evidence-based approaches to platform analysis and media accountability.</p>
<p>In recent years, his projects have centered on large-scale analyses of platform governance and the detection of manipulative tactics across sociotechnical systems—work that often combines computational techniques with theory-driven inquiry. He actively engages with scholarly and policy communities on topics such as transparency in platform data, election integrity, and the societal impacts of algorithmic curation. His current activities build on a sustained track record of collaboration with interdisciplinary teams and public-interest organizations to translate research into actionable insights.</p>
<p>Across more than 20 publications and 1,700+ citations, Professor Giglietto’s scholarship has informed debates on the evolving media ecosystem and the methodological standards of social media research. He regularly shares updates on ongoing projects, open datasets, and methodological tools through professional networks, reflecting his commitment to open, reproducible, and policy-relevant research that supports journalists, researchers, and institutions in navigating today’s information environment.</p>
