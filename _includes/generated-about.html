<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is a Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he teaches Internet Studies and leads research on the interplay between social systems, media, and digital technologies. His work bridges communication theory and computational approaches to the study of digital platforms, with a focus on how information circulates and how socio-technical infrastructures shape public discourse.</p>
<p>Giglietto has published extensively in leading journals including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication & Society, the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. His widely cited publications span topics such as second-screen participation on Twitter, the methodological opportunities and limits of platform data, the dynamics of misinformation in hybrid media systems, and coordinated link-sharing behavior during Italian elections. Collectively, his body of work—encompassing 20 publications and more than 1,700 citations—advances critical and empirical understanding of information flows across contemporary media ecosystems.</p>
<p>His recent projects center on the detection and analysis of networked manipulation, media influence operations, and platform governance, often combining large-scale data collection with transparent, reproducible methods. Building on ongoing conversations across scholarly and practitioner communities, he contributes to debates on disinformation mitigation, audience engagement with news, and accountability in algorithmic content distribution. He frequently collaborates with international partners and research labs focused on computational social science and digital methods.</p>
<p>At Urbino, Professor Giglietto mentors students and early-career researchers, fosters interdisciplinary collaborations, and shares insights from current work-in-progress and community initiatives through professional networks. His teaching and research aim to equip the next generation of scholars and practitioners with theoretical depth and methodological rigor to navigate and shape an increasingly datafied public sphere.</p>
