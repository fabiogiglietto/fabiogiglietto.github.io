<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is a Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo. His research examines how social systems, media, and digital technologies intersect to shape contemporary information flows, public discourse, and civic life. He has published extensively in leading journals including the Journal of Communication; Information, Communication & Society; the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media; Social Media + Society; and Social Science Computer Review.</p>
<p>Professor Giglietto’s work spans computational social science, social media analysis, and the study of mis/disinformation and platformed politics. His publications include widely cited studies such as “Second Screen and Participation: A Content Analysis on a Full Season Dataset of Tweets,” “The open laboratory: Limits and possibilities of using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a research data source,” and “It takes a village to manipulate the media: coordinated link sharing behavior during 2018 and 2019 Italian elections.” He has also contributed to understanding how false information circulates within hybrid news systems and the discursive dynamics surrounding major news events, with a body of work totaling 20 publications and over 1,700 citations.</p>
<p>In recent years, his research has focused on coordinated inauthentic behavior, platform governance, and the detection and analysis of disinformation across networked publics. Drawing on insights shared through his professional networks and ongoing project updates, he engages with cross-institutional teams to advance transparent, reproducible methods for studying large-scale social platforms, including emerging environments. He frequently collaborates on projects that integrate data-driven analyses with critical perspectives on media ecosystems, institutional accountability, and the societal impact of algorithmic systems.</p>
<p>Committed to bridging scholarship and public engagement, Professor Giglietto teaches Internet Studies and mentors students and early-career researchers interested in computational methods, digital trace data, and the ethics of platform research. He regularly contributes to academic and policy discussions on measuring information integrity, media manipulation, and the role of platforms in democratic processes, while sustaining active partnerships across universities, research labs, and civil society organizations.</p>
