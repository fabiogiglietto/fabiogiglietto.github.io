<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he teaches Internet Studies and leads research on how digital platforms shape contemporary information ecosystems. His work explores the theory of information, communication, and society, with a particular focus on the relationships between social systems, media, and digital technologies. He has published widely in leading journals, including the Journal of Communication; Information, Communication & Society; Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media; Social Media + Society; and Social Science Computer Review.</p>
<p>Giglietto’s scholarship combines qualitative insights with computational methods to analyze platform dynamics, audience behaviors, and the circulation of news and misinformation. His publications have examined second-screen engagement during televised events, the methodological opportunities and constraints of using social media as research data, and coordinated link-sharing behaviors around elections. Highly cited works include “Second Screen and Participation: A Content Analysis on a Full Season Dataset of Tweets,” “The Open Laboratory: Limits and Possibilities of Using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a Research Data Source,” and “It Takes a Village to Manipulate the Media: Coordinated Link Sharing Behavior During 2018 and 2019 Italian Elections.”</p>
<p>Recent projects extend this trajectory to the analysis of information integrity, platform governance, and the evolving hybrid news system, with particular attention to how false or misleading content spreads and how researchers can responsibly study it at scale. He actively engages with scholarly and policy communities working on social media transparency, data access, and methodological rigor in computational social science, contributing evidence that informs both academic debates and public discussions on disinformation and media manipulation.</p>
<p>Across more than 20 publications and over 1,700 citations, Giglietto’s research reflects a sustained commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration and open, reproducible science. At Urbino, he mentors students and collaborates with international partners to develop tools and frameworks for studying digital communication in real time. He regularly shares updates on ongoing studies, datasets, and talks through his professional networks, underscoring a dedication to bridging academic research with practical insights for journalists, policymakers, and civil society.</p>
