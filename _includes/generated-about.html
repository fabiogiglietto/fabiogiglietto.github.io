<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he teaches Internet Studies and leads collaborative research on the interplay between social systems, media, and digital technologies. His work advances theory of information, communication, and society, with an empirical focus on how platform infrastructures, news ecosystems, and public discourse intersect. He has published extensively in leading journals including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication & Society, the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review.</p>
<p>Gigliettoâ€™s research spans computational social science, social media analysis, and the study of misinformation, manipulation, and media ecosystems. His widely cited studies include work on second-screen participation during televised events, the methodological potentials and limits of using social platforms as research data sources, and coordinated link-sharing behavior during national elections. He has also examined the circulation of false information in hybrid media systems and the discursive dynamics surrounding crisis events and hashtags. Across a portfolio of 20 publications and more than 1,700 citations, his scholarship combines theoretically grounded inquiry with robust data collection, transparent methods, and reproducible analysis.</p>
<p>In recent years, Giglietto has continued to develop projects that map cross-platform information flows, track coordinated online behavior, and assess the impact of platform governance on news visibility and public debate. His current work involves building open, ethical, and policy-relevant datasets for studying disinformation and media manipulation, along with collaborative initiatives that connect academic research to journalism, civil society, and regulatory discussions. He frequently shares insights from ongoing projects, conference presentations, and research outputs with professional communities and networks, highlighting applications for platform accountability, media pluralism, and evidence-based policy.</p>
<p>As an active member of the international research community, Giglietto mentors students and early-career scholars, contributes to interdisciplinary consortia, and advises on data standards and research transparency. He is committed to bridging rigorous academic research with public impact, developing tools and frameworks that help institutions, newsrooms, and the broader public understand how digital infrastructures shape contemporary communication and democratic life.</p>
