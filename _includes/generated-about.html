<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo. His work examines the theory of information, communication, and society with a particular focus on how social systems, media, and digital technologies intersect. He teaches Internet Studies and leads projects that combine computational methods with critical social science to understand platformed communication, public discourse, and the dynamics of mis/disinformation.</p>
<p>Giglietto’s research has been published in leading journals including Journal of Communication, Information, Communication & Society, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. His highly cited works span second-screen participation on Twitter, the methodological opportunities and limits of using social platforms as research data sources, and the detection of coordinated link-sharing behaviors during Italian elections. He also investigates the circulation of false information within hybrid news systems and the discursive strategies that emerge around major socio-political events.</p>
<p>Recent projects reflect his ongoing commitment to transparent, policy-relevant research on platform governance and information integrity, leveraging large-scale social media datasets, open-source tools, and collaborative, cross-national research networks. He frequently shares insights from ongoing studies of election information ecosystems, platform policy changes, and emerging forms of strategic amplification across networks, bringing together computational social science and qualitative analysis to illuminate how attention and influence are organized online.</p>
<p>Across his teaching, research, and public engagement, Giglietto mentors students and collaborates with journalists, civil society, and institutions to translate rigorous evidence into actionable knowledge. With a portfolio of 20 publications and over 1,800 citations, he continues to advance interdisciplinary understanding of digital media systems and to develop practical approaches for studying complex, rapidly evolving information environments.</p>
