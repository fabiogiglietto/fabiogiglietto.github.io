<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo. His work examines the theory of information, communication, and society with a particular focus on the interplay between social systems, media, and digital technologies. He teaches Internet Studies and leads projects that blend communication theory with computational methods to better understand platform dynamics and their societal impact.</p>
<p>His research has appeared in leading journals such as Journal of Communication, Information, Communication & Society, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. Among his most cited works are studies on second-screen participation, the methodological opportunities and limits of using social platforms as research data sources, the circulation of false information within hybrid news systems, and coordinated link-sharing behavior around elections. With 20 publications and over 1,800 citations, his scholarship contributes both empirical evidence and conceptual clarity to debates on platform governance, misinformation, and public discourse.</p>
<p>Giglietto’s current projects center on social media analysis, disinformation ecosystems, and computational social science approaches to studying political communication and media manipulation. He frequently collaborates on interdisciplinary initiatives that advance transparency and accountability in digital platforms, including the development of open, reproducible workflows for detecting coordinated behaviors and mapping information flows around major civic events. He engages actively with professional networks to share ongoing work, discuss emerging methodological standards, and translate research insights into policy-relevant recommendations.</p>
<p>At Urbino, he mentors students and early-career scholars in research design, data ethics, and mixed-methods analysis, fostering collaborations across academia, civil society, and news organizations. Grounded in a commitment to rigorous methods and public relevance, his teaching and research aim to illuminate how digital infrastructures shape contemporary communication—and how evidence-based interventions can help strengthen informed democratic participation.</p>
