<p>Professor Giglietto's current research interests include coordinated behavior detection and multimodal narratives, as well as the challenges of social media data access in the post-API age. Actively engaged in discussions surrounding platform policies and research methods, he examines the distortion of public opinion and Meta's policy changes regarding inauthentic behavior. Recent work includes analysis of Meta's political content reduction policy and its impact on the reach of Italian Members of Parliament on Facebook. This research revealed a significant reduction in visibility for mainstream politicians, while extremist accounts were able to compensate through increased posting volume.
