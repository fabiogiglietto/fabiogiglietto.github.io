<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is a Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo. His work examines the relationships between social systems, media, and digital technologies, with an emphasis on how information circulates, how publics organize around media events, and how platform infrastructures shape communication. He teaches courses in Internet Studies and contributes to curriculum development and mentoring across programs focused on digital media, data-driven research, and society.</p>
<p>Professor Giglietto’s research spans the theory of information, communication, and society, often employing computational social science methods to study social media dynamics, platform governance, and the spread of false and misleading content online. His publications appear in leading journals including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication &amp; Society, the Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. Notable works include studies on second-screen participation, the methodological opportunities and limits of using social platforms as data sources, coordinated link-sharing behavior during Italian elections, and the circulation of false information within hybrid news systems.</p>
<p>In recent years, he has been active in projects that combine large-scale social media analytics with qualitative and comparative approaches to understand disinformation, political communication, and platform manipulation ecosystems. He frequently shares insights from ongoing research, data collection efforts, and methodological advancements related to election integrity, content moderation, and transparency on emerging and established platforms. This work is reflected in his professional updates and collaborations, which often highlight cross-national studies, open science practices, and tools for monitoring online information flows.</p>
<p>Across his scholarship and public engagement, Professor Giglietto is committed to building bridges between academic research and societal needs—informing policy debates, supporting responsible platform governance, and advancing evidence-based understanding of digital public spheres. With a publication record that includes more than 20 works and over 1,800 citations, he continues to lead interdisciplinary teams, advise on research design and data ethics, and contribute to international networks addressing the challenges and opportunities of our networked information environment.</p>
