<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is a Full Professor of Internet Studies at the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he teaches and mentors students in Internet Studies and computational approaches to communication research. His work examines the theory of information, communication, and society, with a particular focus on the relationships between social systems, media, and digital technologies. He has published extensively in leading journals including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication &amp; Society, the Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review.</p>
<p>Professor Giglietto’s research bridges communication theory and data-driven analysis of digital platforms, investigating how news, political discourse, and misinformation circulate within hybrid media systems. His publications include widely cited studies such as “Second Screen and Participation” (2014), “The Open Laboratory” (2012), “‘Fake News’ Is the Invention of a Liar” (2019), and “It Takes a Village to Manipulate the Media” (2020), contributing to a body of work with over 1,800 citations across 20 publications. He frequently collaborates on interdisciplinary projects that apply computational social science to analyze coordinated online behaviors, platform dynamics, and the societal impact of algorithmically mediated communication.</p>
<p>Recent work has focused on detecting and characterizing coordinated link-sharing and amplification strategies during election periods, mapping cross-platform information flows, and improving the transparency and reproducibility of social media research workflows. In parallel, he engages with ongoing debates on platform governance, data access for research, and the ethical use of digital trace data, drawing on insights from his analyses of disinformation networks and emergent communities on contemporary social platforms.</p>
<p>At Urbino, Professor Giglietto contributes to graduate training and research initiatives that connect theory, methods, and public impact. He regularly shares research updates, preprints, and reflections on evolving platform policies and metrics through his professional social channels, highlighting collaborations, new datasets, and tools supporting open and responsible computational research. His teaching and supervision emphasize critical, rigorous, and societally engaged scholarship that advances understanding of digital media’s role in democratic life.</p>
