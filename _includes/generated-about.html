<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, where he teaches Internet Studies. His work examines the theory of information, communication, and society, with a specific focus on the relationships between social systems, media, and digital technologies. He brings an interdisciplinary perspective to understanding how platforms shape public discourse and how audiences engage with news and political information online.</p>
<p>His research has been published in leading journals including the Journal of Communication; Information, Communication & Society; the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media; Social Media + Society; and Social Science Computer Review. Selected contributions span second-screen participation and political communication, methodological advances in using social media platforms as research data sources, and the dynamics of misinformation in hybrid media systems. Notably cited works include “Second Screen and Participation: A Content Analysis on a Full Season Dataset of Tweets,” “The open laboratory: Limits and possibilities of using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a research data source,” “It takes a village to manipulate the media: coordinated link sharing behavior during 2018 and 2019 Italian elections,” and “‘Fake news’ is the invention of a liar: How false information circulates within the hybrid news system.”</p>
<p>Across a body of 20 publications with over 1,700 citations, Giglietto’s scholarship advances computational and mixed-method approaches to analyze social media ecosystems, information flows, and platform governance. He frequently collaborates with interdisciplinary teams to map coordinated behaviors, track the circulation of problematic content, and assess the societal implications of algorithmic mediation. His current projects continue to explore how digital infrastructures enable and constrain public communication, with an emphasis on transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of platform data.</p>
<p>At Urbino, he mentors students and early-career researchers working at the intersection of media studies, data science, and public communication. He regularly engages with academic and professional communities to translate research insights into practice, contributing to evidence-based discussions about platform accountability, news integrity, and the health of online information environments.</p>
