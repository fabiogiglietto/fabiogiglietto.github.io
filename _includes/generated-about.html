<p>Fabio Giglietto, PhD, is a Full Professor of Internet Studies in the Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo. His work examines how social systems, media, and digital technologies interact, with a particular focus on the theory of information, communication, and society. He teaches and mentors across these areas while collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to advance rigorous, data-informed approaches to understanding the contemporary information environment.</p>
<p>Professor Giglietto has published widely in leading journals, including the Journal of Communication, Information, Communication &amp; Society, the Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media, Social Media + Society, and Social Science Computer Review. His scholarship includes influential studies on second-screen participation, platform data as research infrastructure, and the circulation of misinformation and strategic communication in hybrid media systems. Notable works include “Second Screen and Participation: A Content Analysis on a Full Season Dataset of Tweets,” “The Open Laboratory: Limits and Possibilities of Using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as a Research Data Source,” and recent analyses of coordinated link-sharing behaviors during Italian elections and the dynamics of so‑called “fake news.” Across 20 publications, his research has garnered over 1,800 citations.</p>
<p>His current projects center on computational social science methods for monitoring and analyzing information flows across social platforms, with special attention to disinformation, manipulation tactics, and cross-platform coordination that shape public discourse. He actively engages with the research community to develop transparent, ethical approaches to platform data collection and analysis, and contributes to collaborative initiatives that track emerging narratives, media manipulation techniques, and the evolving role of recommendation systems in news exposure.</p>
<p>Through sustained partnerships and public-facing scholarship, Professor Giglietto bridges academic research and societal impact—translating complex, data-driven findings into insights that inform journalists, policymakers, and civil society. He is committed to open, reproducible research practices and to training the next generation of scholars equipped to study platformized communication and its consequences for democracy, participation, and the public sphere.</p>
